### This repo contains Ruby implementations of
* some fundamental CS algorithms,
* dynamic programming problems,
* katas, puzzles, tips, tricks, etc.

#### Motivation: Practice Ruby coding, improve ruby knowledge, programming, and problem-solving skills.

#### Command line apps can be run directly from command line, e.g.,
``./gesture_passcode_generator method arg1 arg2 ...``

#### run test with ``ruby test/***_test.rb``

#### Todos:

* add more algorithms and tests

* add more command line apps

* add more katas and tests

#### Issues:
